## Description

Aki is a computer enthuastic. He has never been happy with browser bookmarks, they have too little structure to be useful. He would love to have a better system.

Ideally the system should be integrated to the browser and be stored in a centralized database. But just a web site is a good start.

To have better structure for browsing the bookmarks the system should provide categories. Bookmarks should have one or more categories and of course categories should contain many bookmarks.

Bookmarks should also be searchable. It would also be interesting to see some high-level information such as how many bookmarks does a category have.
