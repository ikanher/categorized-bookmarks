## Description

Dave Discer is an enthusiastic disc golf player. Dave and his friends travel all around the country to play disc golf. They play so much that it's a lot of trouble keeping track of their best scores for all possible disc golf courses.

Dave would love a system where they could just enter their scores after the rounds and save the statistics for later analysis. Dave would like to have all their scores in a central place for easy storage and retrieval. It should be possible to keep the scores secret, so that only Dave and his friends are able to see each other's scores. There should be support for multiple teams.

Also seeing some statistics, like average scores per course, would be very interesting.
